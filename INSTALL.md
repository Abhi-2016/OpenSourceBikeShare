4. Create the bicycles in the system in the table `bikes`. Use `standId` from the `stands` table for `currentStand` and set `currentCode` to random four digit code.

Credit system

You can have either credit system enabled (charging per rentals) or disabled (free rentals). Set `$creditsystem` variable accordingly.

* Set `$credit["min"]` to minimum credit required for any bike operations.
* Decide what you want to charge for the rentals and set `$credit["pricecycle"]` accordingly:
    0. One-time only price: 0
    1. Flat price every $watches["flatpricecycle"] minutes: 1
    2. Doubled price every $watches["doublepricecycle"] minutes: 2 (with capping at $watches["doublepricecyclecap"] cycles)
* Set additional charge for long rentals (e.g. over 24 hours) using `$credit["longrental"]` variable.
* If you want to allow users to temporarily increase their rental limit, set `$limitincrease` to number of bikes allowed in addition to their limit. Also set `$credit["limitincrease"]` to require credits for this operation.
* Set system violation fee using `$credit["violation"]`.
