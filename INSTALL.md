Open Source Bike Share Installation Manual
============

Database setup
----------
1. Use `create-database.sql` file to create MariaDB/MySQL database with the system tables.
2. Create an admin user in the table `users` with privileges 7. Remember phone `number` you used for this user.
3. Create the bike stands in the table `stands`, use 0 (zero) for a `serviceTag` to enable the stand or 1 to disable it. Use the same name for `standName` and `placeName`. `standPhoto` is a URL pointing to an image.
4. Create the bicycles in the system in the table `bikes`. Use `standId` from the `stands` table for `currentStand` and set `currentCode` to random four digit code.

Config.php.example setup
----------
1. Open `config.php.example`, rename it to `config.php` and change basic variables (self-descriptive) to suit your system.
2. Set `$countryCode` to your country's international dialing code - no plus sign, no zeroes.
3. _Optional:_ Enable notifications in the `$watches` variables section to notify admins, if conditions met.
4. _Optional:_ Enable paid (credit) system in the `$credit` variables section, if you want charge the users for bike rental based on time and more.
5. Edit database details and fill in correct info.
6. _Optional:_ If you want to have SMS enable in addition to the web app, set the `$connectors["sms"]` variable to your provider's file in `connectors/` directory.

Test (with loopback SMS connector)
----------
1. Open `connectors/loopback/phone.php` and set `$usenumber` variable to the phone `number` of admin user from _step 2_ of _database setup_.
2. Open yourweb/connectors/loopback/phone.php in your browser.
3. Test loopback connector by sending `HELP` command.
4. If you receive message back, everything works.

Watches and notifications (config.php)
----------
Open Source Bicycle Share is a community run system and therefore requires some additional precautions to secure the bicycles.
You can set these using `$watches` variable. Any violations from the set rules will be reported to the admins (with `privileges` 2+) by SMS and by email `$watches["email"]`.
Watch and report:
* if bicycle is taken out of stack, if $forcestack is enabled (see below): `$watches["stack"]`.
* if any long rentals occur: `$watches["longrental"]`. In addition, if `$notifyuser` is set to 1, user will be notified as well to his phone.
* if any user has rented too many bikes during a short period: `$watches["timetoomany"]` and `$watches["numbertoomany"]`.

Additional variables are used by the credit system (if enabled):
* Free rental time: `$watches["freetime"]`.
* Flat price cycle length after first paid period: `$watches["flatpricecycle"]`.
* Double price cycle length after first paid period: `$watches["doublepricecycle"]`.
* Double price cycle capping: `$watches["doublepricecyclecap"]`.

Bicycle stacking at stands (config.php)
----------
You can decide to allow rentals of any bicycle at a stand or only the latest bicycle left at the stand for the security reasons. Use `$forcestack` variable.

Credit system (config.php)
----------
You can have either credit system enabled (charging per rentals) or disabled (free rentals). Set `$creditsystem` variable accordingly.
* Choose your system currency - it could be real money or "points" or whatever. Set `$creditcurrency` accordingly.
* Set `$credit["min"]` to minimum credit required for any bike operations.
* Decide what you want to charge for the rentals and set `$credit["pricecycle"]` accordingly:
    0. One-time only price: 0
    1. Flat price every $watches["flatpricecycle"] minutes: 1
    2. Doubled price every $watches["doublepricecycle"] minutes: 2 (with capping at $watches["doublepricecyclecap"] cycles)
* Set additional charge for long rentals (e.g. over 24 hours) using `$credit["longrental"]` variable.
* If you want to allow users to temporarily increase their rental limit, set `$limits["increase"]` to number of bikes allowed in addition to their limit. Also set `$credit["limitincrease"]` to require credits for this operation.
* Set system violation fee using `$credit["violation"]`.

CRON job
----------
1. _Optional:_ If you have some `$watches` notifications enabled, add `cron.php` to be called once a day.

User registration
----------
* Set `$limits["registration"]` to number of bikes user can rent after he registered. 0 is recommended, if you run a community system (admin can change this limit after verification).
1. Point users to yourweb/register.php to register.

Connectors (SMS provider files)
----------
1. See `eurosms.php` connector file for basic structure of the API connector.
2. Set the basic variables (provided by your SMS gateway API) such as API username, API password/key, system phone number etc.
3. SMS receiving requires SMS text, sender, time and unique ID to be set.
4. SMS sending requires `Send()` function to be edited.
5. If your SMS provider expects a response after SMS is received via API, edit `Respond()` function as needed (usually responding with SMS unique ID).
